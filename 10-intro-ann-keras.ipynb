    "# Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a documentation of my work through Chapter 10 of [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291).  This chapter is an introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using Keras and Tensorflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Playground\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, the [Tensorflow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org) is a great place to gain some intuition about how ANNs work.  You can change hyperparameters live and see the effect in real time on the output, training, loss, etc.  You can also view each individual weight and output.  "
